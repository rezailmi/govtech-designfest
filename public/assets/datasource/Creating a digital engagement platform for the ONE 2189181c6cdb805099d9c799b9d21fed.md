## Synopsis 📝

Ever wonder what it takes to truly connect a large community in the digital age?

Join us for an insightful session delving into the creation of a brand-new digital engagement platform for the ONE Changi Community. We'll explore the thinking behind this project, starting with a brief overview of our foundational principles: Quality Service Management (QSM) and Collaborative Design (CoDE).

Discover why ONE Changi 3.0 was initiated, the work involved in its development, and how we successfully co-created a user-centric platform.
