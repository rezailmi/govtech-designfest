## Synopsis 📝

When we talk about accessibility, we often focus on people with disabilities or the elderly — but what about the youngest users in our education systems? In this talk, we’ll explore the “forgotten middle” — children who don’t have special needs but are still underserved by adult-centric UX.

Drawing from a recent research with over 400 primary school students in Singapore, this session gives us an opportunity to understand unique behaviours, motivations, and struggles of early learners navigating logging in to digital interfaces.

You’ll see some surprising moments and interaction patterns that challenge commonly accepted UX principles and discover why these break down for children.

The speaker will share a possible heuristic framework for designing digital systems that support younger learners and call for collaboration to stack more learnings, past / future research to enrich this further together.
