## Synopsis 📝

Building a startup means moving fast. But that doesn’t have to mean cutting corners - especially when understanding your users, or developing and scaling your product. Tara unpacks the art of scrappy (but not at all crappy) research, that you can implement, whatever your background. We’ll show you how to approach some of the most common product and user needs, through tried and tested shortcuts that are quick, actionable, and even a little fun 🥳! From how Pixar Stories teach Product Market Fit, to why Breakups are the key to finding your P0 Consumer Metrics to track and fix - think of it as the “Freakonomics of research” - breaking down the complex into memorable, relatable shortcuts that you can easily apply, wherever you are in your product journey.
