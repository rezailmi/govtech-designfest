## Synopsis 📝

A candid reflection on our learnings from conducting focus group discussion – learn about how this method enabled us to dive deep into our users’ minds and unlock insights. We take you through 2 different case studies where we put this to practice, from government and citizen research projects.

This session explores the practical realities of expanding UX research methods, the unique challenges of focus group facilitation, and why this underutilized method deserves a place in our research toolkit.

We discuss the powers and limitations of this method, and share our practical tips on how and when you should run one.
