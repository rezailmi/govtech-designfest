## Synopsis 📝

This talk will be based on learning from Ontological coaching and the model of BEL (Body, Emotions, Language). Understanding the center of these elements and how they interact to shape the kind of observer we are is very helpful for us to expand our capacity to learn, understand others, build relationship s and achieve results.
