# **Agenda**

11am - Registration @ MBC 10 The Big Place

11.15am - **Fireside chat: Why isn’t empathy enough?**

If public officers care deeply about users, why aren’t our government service experiences the best they can be, and how can we change this from within? Join us for an intimate session with MOS Jasmin, who will speak candidly about the challenges and opportunities in building truly user-centric digital public services.
