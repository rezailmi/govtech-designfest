Location: DBS

Get a glimpse of the action from DBS Service Designers as they share case studies and examples of how DBS designs journeys that are end-to-end, cross-persona and that go beyond the digital realm. Learn about their Service Design Playbook and how itâ€™s played a key role in creating value and impact for the business and their customers.

Youâ€™ll participate in a hands-on activity to apply service design and explore ways you can bring this mindset and approach back to your own organisation.
