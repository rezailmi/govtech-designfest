## Synopsis 📝

Accessibility can feel like a big, complex topic — and honestly, it still feels a little intimidating at times. This talk shares how that journey began: attending A11y talks at work, learning the basics, adding annotations to designs, and eventually encouraging the team to start their own learning journeys. It also touches on how AI tools have been used to support this work — not just to save time, but to help us learn and get better at writing accessibility annotations together. 

Some of the topics that will be covered include: 

- Initial thoughts and fears around accessibility as WCAG seemed overwhelming
- Starting with learning the basics (e.g. perceivable, operable, understandable, robust principles)
- Noticing others felt just as unsure, and realising that you didn’t need to be an expert to get started
- AI not just as a shortcut, but a tool to upskill and reinforce good accessibility thinking
- Making peace with “still learning” (progress over perfection!)
