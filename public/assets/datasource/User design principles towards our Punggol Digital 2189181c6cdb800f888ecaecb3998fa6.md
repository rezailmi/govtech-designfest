## Synopsis 📝

Join us as we share how we applied LUMA Design Thinking methods to run Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) that shaped GovTech’s move to the Punggol Digital District (PDD).

From Jan to Apr 2025, we engaged GovTechies across divisions to understand their needs and concerns for the new office. Guided by “How Might We” statements, we uncovered key insights around commuting and collaboration spaces. These informed problem statements, sparked ideation, and led to low-fidelity mockups (e.g. storyboards on shuttle services and mission-centric workspaces).

Lastly, we’ll share how we engaged and educated GovTechies through roadshows, internal comms, and a dedicated PDD microsite to support a smooth and informed transition.

## About Speaker ✨

Hi I’m Alan and I'm a certified LUMA practitioner, and I use Design Thinking methodologies to facilitate focus groups. One of the more fun sessions were the PDD (Punggol Digital District) focus groups that we delivered, where we dug deeper to understand Govtechies’ excitement, wish-lists, pain-points and pushback around the upcoming move to Punggol.
