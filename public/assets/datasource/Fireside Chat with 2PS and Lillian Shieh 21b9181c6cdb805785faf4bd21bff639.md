Join us for a candid Fireside Chat between Augustin Lee, 2nd Permanent Secretary, MDDI, and Lillian Shieh, Head of Design Practice, GovTech, as they explore the role of design in shaping digital government services and outcomes.

In this conversation, we‚Äôll dig into:

- What assumptions do policymakers often make about user behaviour?
- Are we designing policies for the ideal citizen, or the real citizen with real constraints?
- How can frontline pain points and lived experiences be surfaced earlier in the policy cycle?
- What does ‚Äútrust‚Äù look like in a digital service‚Äîbeyond compliance and security?
- Can government really design for trust, dignity, and equity at scale?

This session is for anyone working at the intersection of policy, technology, and service design. It will offer insights and a fresh look at the role design plays in making public services work better for everyone.
