## Synopsis 📝

In this engaging session, we will explore two key concepts. One is that who we are as a person makes a difference in the impact we have beyond the tools we bring, and the other is that it is important for us to pay attention to levels of the system, so we can maximise the effectiveness of what we do.

We will play with a variety of practical tools, at intrapersonal, partnering with others, and working in complex systems levels. Everyone will walk away with 2-3 ideas that can be implemented right away.
