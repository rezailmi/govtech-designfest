## Synopsis 📝

Wayfinding isn’t just about signs, it’s about alignment. Before design makes an impact, we need to ask if we’re even navigating the same problem.

## About Speaker ✨

Samuel is a wayfinding strategist who helps cities make sense of complex spaces. He led the design of signage and system maps for the Singapore MRT, Doha Metro, and Lusail Tram, and now runs Studio Lucidus, a consultancy that brings clarity to both stakeholders and end users.
