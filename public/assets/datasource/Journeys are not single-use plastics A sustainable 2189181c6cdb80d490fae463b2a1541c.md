## Synopsis 📝

Are journey maps like single-use plastics? This was the guiding question that led me on my journey on maps after seeing how often we leave them aside after their key usage, mainly during a presentation to stakeholders after an important decision, never looking at them again. We can definitely change that with some reframing.

Explore how some companies and designers are challenging these conventional norms. Learn how some teams are applying an advanced way of journey mapping. Create new steps for yourself and your team. Let's learn about a sustainable approach to making reusable maps.
