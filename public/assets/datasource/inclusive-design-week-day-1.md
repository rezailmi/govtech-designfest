### **Building an inclusive Smart Nation starts with us**

Join us virtually and/or physically from 29 July to 31 July for Inclusive Design Week 2025 (previously known as A11y week) as part of GovTech’s month-long Design Festival. Learn from Design and Accessibility experts, from various government agencies, private industries like Apple, DBS Bank, Figma, National Institute of Education, and Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).

Inclusive Design Week is the Government’s digital inclusion learning festival for all public officers, especially those making Singapore a Smart (and Inclusive) Nation. We look forward to hosting you as we share best practices, case studies, tools, and resources that enable us to build a more accessible and inclusive Singapore.
