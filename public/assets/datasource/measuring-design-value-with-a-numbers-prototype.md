## About Speaker :✨

Derrick’s a UX designer who spent years gently whispering that good design has ROI — mostly to himself, in dark rooms. Like everyone else, he tiptoed around saying design has value (because, you know, this is a tech company). Then aliens abducted him (true story, don’t ask), and now he’s back on Earth with a mission: convince just one other non-alien about the business value of design... or worse — spend eternity reading every word in Comic Sans.
