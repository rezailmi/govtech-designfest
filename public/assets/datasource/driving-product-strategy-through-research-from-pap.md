## Synopsis 📝

"How many paper forms are left in the Singapore government?" 

Tackling this broad and ambitious question, Alicia led a six-month, mixed-methods research project that shaped product strategy and direction on FormSG. She'll share how she designed the research approach, synthesised insights from diverse data sources, and guided the team through critical decisions. 

This talk highlights how design-led research can be used to create clarity, drive alignment, influence the product roadmap, and deliver meaningful impact, while also shedding light on key lessons learned throughout the process.
