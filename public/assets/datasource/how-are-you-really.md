## Synopsis 📝

“How Are You, Really?”

Most of us answer that question on autopilot. But beneath the surface, many designers quietly wrestle with burnout, self-doubt, or a lingering sense of disconnection–especially in fast-moving, high-impact environments. In this talk, Jia Eenn shares a personal reflection framework that helped bring clarity and intention back into her work and life. Whether you’re feeling stretched thin or simply ready to check in with yourself, this is an invitation to pause, reflect, and reconnect.

*P.S. You’re encouraged to bring a pen and paper, and to tune in on your earphones if you can.*
