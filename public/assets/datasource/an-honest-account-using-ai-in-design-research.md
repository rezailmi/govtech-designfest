## Synopsis 📝

AI is often framed as a magic wand that can help us work faster and better. Curious to see how AI could (or could not!) augment research work, I explored integrating it into my design research process. In this talk, I will share case studies of how I used AI in research prototyping and synthesis. Along with lessons learned, I hope this presentation helps you navigate your journey of creating an AI-assisted research workflow.

## About Speaker ✨

Hello! I’m Serah. I'm passionate about using research to connect businesses and cross-functional teammates with the people we're designing for. Whenever possible, I explore new tools and approaches to make these connections stronger and more meaningful.

I’m currently with GPE, on the Workpal Project.
