# Typo Check Report - GovTech Design Festival

## Summary
I have conducted a comprehensive review of all content in the workspace, with special attention to location-related information. Here are my findings:

## ✅ Overall Assessment
The content is generally well-written with minimal typos. The location information is mostly consistent and accurate.

## 🔍 Issues Found

### 1. Location Inconsistencies

#### MBC 10 Location References
**Found in multiple files:** Inconsistent formatting of the same location
- `MBC 10 - Level 10 (The Big Place)` (keynotes.ts)
- `MBC 10 L10 The Big Place` (event-details.ts, agenda.ts)
- `MBC10 The Big Place` (event-details.ts - in agenda item)

**Recommendation:** Standardize to `MBC 10 - Level 10 (The Big Place)` for consistency.

### 2. Minor Text Issues

#### In `src/data/event-details.ts`
- Line 53: `"2.15pm - Registration @ MBC10 The Big Place"` - Missing space before "The"
- Line 150: `"10.45am - Registration @ MBC 10 The Big Place"` - Inconsistent format (should include "Level 10")
- Line 180: `"11am - Registration @ MBC 10 The Big Place"` - Same inconsistency

#### In `README.md`
- Line 220: `**Built with ❤️ for GovTech DesignFest Event** 🎉` - "DesignFest" should be "Design Festival" for consistency

### 3. Missing Information
Some events have placeholder text that should be updated:
- `src/data/event-details.ts` line 416: `"*Description of talk to be provided later.*"` for Amanda Lu's talk

## ✅ Positive Findings

### Singapore Location Names
All Singapore-specific locations are correctly spelled:
- ✅ Changi (correctly spelled in "ONE Changi Community")
- ✅ Punggol (correctly spelled in "Punggol Digital District")
- ✅ Singapore (consistently correct throughout)
- ✅ GovTech (consistently correct)

### Venue Names
All venue names are correctly spelled:

### Technical Terms
All technical and design-related terms are correctly spelled:
- ✅ accessibility, inclusivity

## 📋 Recommended Actions

### High Priority
1. **Standardize MBC 10 location format** across all files to: `MBC 10 - Level 10 (The Big Place)`
2. **Fix spacing issue** in agenda timestamps: `MBC10` → `MBC 10`

### Medium Priority  
3. **Update README.md** to use consistent naming: `DesignFest` → `Design Festival`
4. **Complete placeholder content** for Amanda Lu's talk description

### Low Priority
5. **Review time format consistency** (some use "10.45am", others use "10:45 AM")

## 🎯 Files Reviewed
- All TypeScript/JavaScript files (*.ts, *.tsx, *.js)
- All Markdown files (*.md)
- All JSON configuration files
- All data files containing location information

## 📍 Location Data Quality
The location information is generally accurate and well-structured. Singapore geography and venue names are all correctly referenced. The main issues are formatting consistency rather than factual errors.
